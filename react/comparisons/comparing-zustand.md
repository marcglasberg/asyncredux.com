# Comparing with Zustand

Zustand is a barebones state management solution,
providing just the essentials needed for state management without extensive
setup or complexity. For advanced features you need to install separate packages.

Async Redux also doesn't need any extensive setup, and is not more complex than Zustand.
However, Async Redux is not barebones: The advanced features are there when you need them.
It deals natively with serializing, running async processes, displaying spinners
while loading, showing error messages, saving the state to the local storage, and testing.
