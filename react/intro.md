# Getting Started

Async Redux is:

* Simple to learn and easy to use
* Powerful enough to handle complex applications with millions of users
* Testable

This means you'll be able to create web and mobile apps much faster,
and other people on your team will easily understand and modify your code.

## What is it?

Async Redux is an optimized, unofficial version of Redux.
It was written from the ground up and shares no code with the original Redux.
It was created by [Marcelo Glasberg](https://github.com/marcglasberg),
and launched in July 2024.

While new for React, Async Redux is a mature solution,
having been [available for Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/async_redux) for a few years.
There, it ranks among the top 8% of most used packages,
and its features have been battle-tested in hundreds of real-world applications.

## Installation

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```npm
npm install async-redux-react
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```yarn
yarn add async-redux-react
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## How does it compare?

Front-end developers learning state management solutions are
sometimes overwhelmed by the complexity of concepts they have to grasp,
and the large knowledge overhead needed just to navigate the pitfalls.

Async Redux aims to be the opposite of that:
You don't need to be super clever about approaching things just to make them work.

While striving to be simple, Async Redux doesn't reinvent the wheel,
and draws inspiration and good ideas from these solutions:

* [Comparing with Redux Toolkit](./comparisons/comparing-redux)
* [Comparing with TanStack Query](./comparisons/comparing-tanstack)
* [Comparing with Zustand](./comparisons/comparing-zustand)
* [Comparing with MobX](./comparisons/comparing-mobx)

Next, let's follow a short tutorial to see how easy it is to use Async Redux.
We'll create a simple _Todo List_ app.
