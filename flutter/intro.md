# Getting Started

Async Redux is:

* Simple to learn and easy to use
* Powerful enough to handle complex applications with millions of users
* Testable

This means you'll be able to create your apps much faster,
and other people on your team will easily understand and modify your code.

## What is it?

Async Redux is an optimized, unofficial version of Redux, created
by [Marcelo Glasberg](https://github.com/marcglasberg).
It's a mature solution, available since August 2019,
meaning its features have been battle-tested in hundreds of real-world applications.

Since July 2024, it's also available for [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/async-redux-react).

Async Redux is a complete state management solution, and doesn't compete with
packages like Provider and Flutter Hooks, which are not. On the contrary, it can
optionally be [used with them](./category/other-packages), although that's not necessary.

However, Async Redux is an alternative to Bloc, MobX, and the original vanilla Redux.
It is designed to be easier to use than those, and to help you create stable apps
that are easier to test, maintain and extend.

## Installation

Add the dependency to your `package.json` (check
the [most recent version here](https://pub.dev/packages/async_redux)):

```yaml
  dependencies:
    async_redux: ^23.1.1
```

## How does it compare?
