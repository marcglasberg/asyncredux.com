    "description": "What is Redux? A single store object holds all the application state, which is immutable. When you need to modify some state, you dispatch an action. Then a reducer creates a new copy of the state, with the desired changes. Your widgets know when the state changes, and rebuild as needed. The next pages explain all the basic Async Redux concepts."
