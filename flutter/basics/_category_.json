    "description": "What is Redux? A single immutable object holds all the application state. When you need to modify some part of the state, you dispatch an action. Then the action's reducer creates a new copy of the state, with the desired changes. Your widgets listen to state changes, and rebuild as needed. The next pages explain all the basic Async Redux concepts."
