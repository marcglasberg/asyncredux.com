# IDE Navigation

How does AsyncRedux solve the IDE navigation problem?

During development, if you need to see what some action does, you just tell your IDE to navigate to
the action itself
(`CTRL+B` in IntelliJ/Windows, for example) and you have the reducer right there.

If you need to list all of your actions, you just go to the `ReduxAction` class declaration and ask
the IDE to list all of its subclasses.
